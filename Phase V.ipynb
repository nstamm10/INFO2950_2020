For example, if the best team in the league is playing the worst, the spread might be **-14**. This means that if I bet on the best team in the league, they must win by at more than 14 points for me to receive winnings. Conversely, I could bet on the worst team who would have the opposite spread of **+14**. In order to win this bet, the worst team would have to either win the game outright or lose by less than 14 points."

If it was more than 55%, it would bet on the favorite, and if it was less than 45%, it would bet on the underdog.

This means that the model is taking into account a teams historical performances against the spread and using it to determine what will happen in the future. However, this might not always be a great way to use the data. For example, the Clevland Browns are a historically bad franchise; however, they have a very good team right now. Therefore, the model might not account for the Browns turing their team around."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Another limitation is that I only have high level statistics. I have the home and away teams as well as the schedule week and weather. However, these stats are not indicative of what will happen during the actual course of the game. If the dataset was larger, I could have included the teams individual record at the time of the game and player statistics. For example, if a team has the leagues MVP, that will probably affect how often they cover a spread. The dataset also could be more robust by including player injuries. Injuries often have large impacts on teams throughout the course of the season, yet my model does not account for any of them."

    "Finally, there is a bias in my data cleaning that affects my overall outcome model. I remove many columns in the original data set such as weather type (such as rain, snow, cloudy, etc.) and the over/under line that I assumed did not matter and did not want to analyze. In football, the over/under line is another gambling line that allows viewers to bet on the total amount of points scored in a particular game. I now think that this line would have a noticable effect on the outcome of the spread because if the spread is set high (ie. -14) and the over/under line is only 38, it will be very difficult for the favorite to cover because they must score pretty much all the points in the game."
